# A-Deep-Learning-based-App
In this repository we present our MVP created during the 2019 FioCruz Hackaton competition

Our Main Goal here is a application that can help its user identify ticks using A.I, as well as giving the end user of how to proceed based on this identification.

Based on this we can see our Product growing , so it can both help the common citizen, as well as people working in the healthcare industry, or academics in related fields, who can use the data generated by our results to both identify where different tick species are being identified, as well as epidemiology modelling , among other interesting studies
